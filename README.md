# Document-Classification

Managing the explosive growth of unstructured data stands as a pivotal hurdle in data mining, text analytics, and data analysis. Roughly 80% of global data exists in an unstructured state, often remaining unexplored due to the complexities involved in analysis. Ensuring the reliability of text document classification, which hinges on user preferences amid an abundance of terms and data patterns, poses a significant challenge. With the rapid expansion of the World Wide Web and the surge in electronic document availability, automated document categorization emerges as a linchpin for methodically organizing information and facilitating knowledge discovery.

Text classification concerns defining the type, genre, or theme of the text based on its content. Depending on the task, complex techniques like NLP can be used to analyze words and phrases in context and understand their semantics. To classify documents based on their context, the context-based approach is needed to be followed. Semantic analysis of the text overcomes the limitations of the term-based approach and it also enhances the accuracy of the classifiers. Text document data has been classified into 5 categories as of initial prospective: Politics, Sport, Technology, Entertainment, Business.
